# Database Seeding

This directory contains scripts for setting up and seeding the clinic assistant database.

## Setup

1. **Generate Prisma Client:**

   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   ```

2. **Push Schema to Database:**

   ```bash
   npx prisma db push
   ```

3. **Seed the Database:**
   ```bash
   npm run db:seed
   ```

Or run the complete setup:

```bash
./scripts/setup-db.sh
```

## What Gets Created

The seeding script creates:

- **3 Doctors** with different specialties
- **15 Doctor Schedules** (5 days Ã— 3 doctors)
- **3 Sample Patients**
- **4 Sample Reservations** (2 for today, 2 for tomorrow)

## Doctor IDs

After seeding, you'll get these doctor IDs:
